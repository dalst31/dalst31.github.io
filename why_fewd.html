<h1>Why Fewd? Why Now?</h1>

<h2>After years of procrastination, the time has come to learn to build a website, on my own, without the help of my development team or various friends who are sick of me pestering them. Always saying to myself "I'll learn this one day in the future"...as of September, 2018, THE FUTURE IS NOW. (God Speed)</h2>

<p>As I embark on the voyage to front end development literacy, the following rules of engagement will apply (God willing):
<ul>
	<li>Don't Panic: maintain calm demeanor and composure when inevitably lost in the land of javascript</li>
	<li>Act Natural: Project an air of knowledge, determination and leadership in the face of confusion </li>
	<li>Send Help: Solicit assistance from classmates, colleages, friends, Romans, Countrymen and the national guard to finally gain a firm grasp and understanding of hmtl, css and javascript (god help us) </li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>Here are links to my work thus far...read 'em and weep, or roll eyes, or face palm, or sigh...whichever seems most appropriate for you:</p>
